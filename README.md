## Description

This practical work consists of three interactive JavaScript exercises aiming to improve our understanding of user input handling, loops, conditionals, and basic DOM manipulation (us the students of this subject).

Each exercise is built using HTML & JavaScript (I moght add CSS later).

## It Features

1. **Simple Calculator**: In the 1st exercise, creating a calculator that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (`somme`, `difference`, `produit`, and `quotient`) between two numbers entered by the user. The user can press a button to redo the operation, and the results are displayed through alerts.

2. **Random Number Guessing Game**: For this 2nd exercise, the user is asked to guess a random number between 1 and 10, then it gives feedback on whether the `guess` is too high or too low, and tracks the number of attempts made. If the user presses *Cancel*, the game restarts.

3. **Quiz Game**: In this quiz (3rd one), the user is asked a series of questions, and their answers are compared to the correct ones. At the end of the quiz, the score is displayed, showing the number of *correct*, *wrong*, and *skipped answers*. The user is also shown the corrected answers after completing the quiz.

### I felt nostalgic for ***C*** when exploring this JavaScript for the first time XD
